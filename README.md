# Registix Nuxt Frontend

This repository contains **only** the Nuxt frontend code for the `Registix` project.

- **GitHub repository URL**: `https://github.com/madebyanalogue/roleplay.git`
- **Important**: This folder (`roleplay-nuxt`) is the only folder committed to git. The Sanity Studio is kept separately.

## Project Structure

```
roleplay/
├── roleplay-nuxt/      ← This folder (Nuxt code only - committed to git)
└── roleplay-studio/    ← Sanity Studio (all Sanity code - NOT committed to git)
